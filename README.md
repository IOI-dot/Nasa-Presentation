**Team:** ExoPlantDetectors  
**Leader:** Omar Abdel Motalb  
**Members:** Abdel Rahman Abdel Motalb, Mohamed Samir, Mohand Fouda  
**Challenge Chosen:** [A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/challenges/a-world-away-hunting-for-exoplanets-with-ai/)

## 🚀 Project Summary
Celestial Ai is an interactive artificial intelligence platform that detects, classifies, and visualizes exoplanets using NASA’s Kepler open dataset.  
Powered by a HistGradientBoostingClassifier trained on ten Kepler features, the system classifies candidates as confirmed exoplanets, potential candidates, or false positives.  

The web app provides real-time analysis, a 3D Exoplanet Explorer, an Artistic Galaxy Mode, and an educational “Guess the Exoplanet” game — merging science, visualization, and gamified learning.

## 🛠 Features & Workflow
- **Batch & Single Analysis** – Upload data or enter features for classification.  
- **Pretrained + Retrain Option** – Use our model or retrain with new datasets.  
- **3D Exoplanet Explorer** – Explore NASA data in interactive 3D space.  
- **Artistic Mode** – Transform data into a galaxy-inspired map.  
- **Gamified Learning** – Play *Guess the Exoplanet* to understand classification logic.
